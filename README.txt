In nn_from_scratch.ipynb notebook you can find code for a neural network with 2 layers. 

This code is based on the NumPy library, thus all formulas such as data preparation, forward/backward propagation, loss function, gradient update, zerograd and training process are developed from scratch. 

TODO: 
1. Combine all functions into the classes
